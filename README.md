# toolkit
A list of go tools which are useful when doing go development. They are 
not mearnt to replace existing go offical tools but to complement those tools
to better suit our daily work. Use them with caution!

Below is a list of tools:
- importtidier: It helps to tidy import groups which goimports would miss or not do such as local package handling
- mocker: It helps with unit testing where one may need to mock functions/variables. 
  - restore_mock: It offers function/variable mock restore capabilities. The details can be understood from [Restore mocked variables in GoLang unit test](https://www.pixelstech.net/article/1639186594-Restore-mocked-variables-in-GoLang-unit-test)
